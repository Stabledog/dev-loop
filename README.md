## dev-loop development

The ~/bin/dev-loop.sh script is maintained in this repo.  We don't have our own taskrc because
that would be confusing, as dev-loop.sh depends on the target project's taskrc as well.

```bash
#  function vscode_sh_init {
       #Help (this runs when vscode starts a terminal)
#      echo -n
# }
```
