# Codegen templates

Each file is potentially the usable in taskrc (with editing).  Running


Example:
```bash
dev-loop codegen python3
```
Invokes the script `dev-loop/codegen/python3.sh`, which should spit out code that can
populate run_one(), debug_one(), and supporting elements for generation of a taskrc{.md}
